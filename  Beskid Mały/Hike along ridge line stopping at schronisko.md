On Saturday 4th of May weâ€™ll do a 15.2km there and back hike along a ridge line in the Beskid MaÅ‚y mountain range to a mountain hut

Again we'll meet at 9am, since the sun sets around 7 or 8pm this gives us plenty of time. I was planning to go on Sunday but the weather is looking better for Saturday. Sorry for late notice, in general I'll try to post hike announcements at least by Tuesday for a weekend hike.

*Difficulty Level*

Weâ€™ll go at quite easy pace. Weâ€™ll have plenty of time to walk the 15.2km. But note weâ€™ll be ascending in total 714m mostly at the beginning of the hike but along the rolling ridge line, this is compared to 760m last Sunday which many people found challenging, hopefully the path will be a little drier and easier than the path last week but you can never tell.

*Meeting points:*

1) In town outside BocheÅ„ska 2 in Kazimierz at *9am*:

*Expecting to be back in town*

Probably back around roughly 6 or 7pm.

*To Bring*

The weather is looking good for this weekend. ðŸ™‚ It is currently forecast to be 19 centigrade on the trail. But bring layers of clothes and a waterproof coat, there is a 24% chance of rain. This is according to weather forecast on AllTrails.com

Youâ€™ll need some shoes with a good grip on the bottom. But sports shoes will probably work if they have a fair grip.

There is a mountain hut up there we will visit for lunch but bring your own food if you prefer and maybe some snacks for the trail. And some water.

*Transport Arrangement*

Weâ€™ll carpool out to the hike either in peopleâ€™s personal cars or in hire cars. Car hire will likely be around 180 zÅ‚ for car for the day with insurance and petrol roughly 70 - 90 zÅ‚, costs which weâ€™ll split between people in the cars.

People who have cars with spare places, please coordinate through this chat to arrange with others to share transport costs.
