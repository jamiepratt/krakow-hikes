here is a summary of all the info about the hike which I will make a pinned post.


we’ll follow this trail, which is 12.2km involving 370m of ascent uphill

for this hike sports shoes would be fine although hiking boots might be more comfortable.

unfortunately it looks like the weather next weekend won’t be as nice as it is right now. It’ll be cooler at only 14 centigrade so probably wear fairly warm clothes with layers you can put on or take off as needed a raincoat might also be a good idea and a backpack with some water and some possibly some lunch and snacks.

This is the bus people can take as I said the bus is likely to be crowded so if you want a place on the bus I would recommend to get to the bus stop maybe 15 minutes early and queue.

The bus is scheduled to leave at 9:42 and stops at 10:27 at Będkowice Pętla.

Kraków, Muzeum Narodowe to
Będkowice Pętla

At the stop Kraków, Muzeum Narodowe get on the MPK Kraków bus no. 310 towards Będkowice Pętla and go 25 stops (45min) to the stop Będkowice Pętla.

There is a car park 6 minutes walk away. For those in cars I think it’d be good idea to go a little early to find a parking space and meet everyone else at the Będkowice Pętla bus stop, meet at bus stop at 10:20.
