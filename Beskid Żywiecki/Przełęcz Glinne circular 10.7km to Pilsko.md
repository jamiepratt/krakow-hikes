On Sunday 28th of April weâ€™ll do a circular 10.7 km hike along the border with Slovakia, weâ€™ll drive up to 800m above sea level and hike to the peak of Pilsko at 1535m above sea level, the highest point of the hike.

Note the later 9am start time from Krakow! A more civilised start to Sunday.

*Difficulty Level*

Weâ€™ll go at quite easy pace. Weâ€™ll have plenty of time to walk the 10.7km. Weâ€™ll be ascending 760m (and then of course going back down again).

*Meeting points:*

*Expecting to be back in town*

Probably back around roughly 6 or 7pm.

*To Bring*

The weather is looking good for this weekend. ðŸ™‚ It is currently forecast to be 19 centigrade on the trail. But bring layers of clothes and a waterproof coat.

Youâ€™ll need some shoes with a good grip on the bottom. But sports shoes will probably work if they have a fair grip.

There is a mountain hut up there we will visit for lunch but bring your own food if you prefer and maybe some snacks for the trail. And some water.

*Transport Arrangement*

Weâ€™ll carpool out to the hike either in peopleâ€™s personal cars or in hire cars. Car hire will likely be around 180 zÅ‚ for car for the day with insurance and petrol roughly 120 - 150 zÅ‚, costs which weâ€™ll split between people in the cars.

People who have cars with spare places, please coordinate through this chat to arrange with others to share transport costs.
