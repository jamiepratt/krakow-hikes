review after May 12th 2024 hike:

a great trail very accessible from the center of Kraków. Was really quiet on the trail with few other hikers and very picturesque.


I plan to do this fairly flat 19km trail on Sunday 12th May: https://mapa-turystyczna.pl/route/3a2a6

I was originally thinking of hiking on Saturday, but the weather is looking better for Sunday.

Something a bit closer and probably easier than recent hikes. The hike can be cut short halfway at 9.17km, if 19km seems daunting. From where there are various public transport options to travel back to Kraków: https://maps.app.goo.gl/GSkM1msYmzqnXWdx8

There is a 25-minute train out there we can catch. Leaving at 9:33 AM firm Kraków Main Station a regular train SKA3 “REG30712”  that goes to Oświęcim, platform I according to Google maps : https://maps.app.goo.gl/MTLH3tNBNQkDhFC29

Then there is are several buses we can catch back to town from the other end of the hike. See screenshot from Jakdojade.

We’ll hike past Źródło krasowe , a natural spring here : https://maps.app.goo.gl/uKGjdrFu8Ldgfp4E9

So let’s aim to be at the train station about 9:20 am and meet on the platform for the train.

It’s a red trail close to Krakow. “These are long-distance trails that often run across multiple regions or even the entire country. Red trails are typically designed to connect significant or culturally important sites, and they may involve varied terrains and longer, more challenging hikes.” Am hoping it won't be too crowded with people enjoying the early summer.
