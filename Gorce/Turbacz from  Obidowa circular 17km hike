On Sunday 21st of April weâ€™ll do a circular 15.6 km hike on ridgelines, weâ€™ll drive up to 780m above sea level and hike to the peak of Turbacz at 1310m, the highest point of the hike.

*Difficulty Level*

Weâ€™ll go at quite easy pace. Weâ€™ll have plenty of time to walk the 15.6km. Weâ€™ll be ascending over 500m and then back down again, it wonâ€™t be very steep.

*Meeting points:*

1) In town outside BocheÅ„ska 2 in Kazimierz at 8am:

*Expecting to be back in town*

Probably back around roughly 6 or 7pm.

*To Bring*

The weather may not be great but that wonâ€™t stop us. ðŸ™‚ There is a chance of rain and it is currently forecast to be 4 centigrade on the trail. So bring some warm layers of clothes and a waterproof coat.

Youâ€™ll need some shoes with a good grip on the bottom. But sports shoes will probably work if they have a fair grip.

There is a mountain hut up there we will visit for lunch but bring your own food if you prefer and maybe some snacks for the trail. And some water.

*Transport Arrangement*

Weâ€™ll carpool out to the hike either in peopleâ€™s personal cars or in hire cars. Car hire will likely be around 180 zÅ‚ for car for the day with insurance and petrol 90 zÅ‚, costs which weâ€™ll split between people in the cars.

People who have cars with spare places, please coordinate through this chat to arrange with others to share transport costs.
